* Parametrize the things with specification about sequential consistency
  - So people can rely on relative order of insertions, etc.
* Valgrind into CI
* Split the raw/mod.rs into multiple files? It is definitely getting a bit long.
* Some refactoring around the pointer juggling in raw
  - The manual casting seems a bit error prone
  - Should we have our own wrapper that loads and gives some king of Option<Either<&Payload, &Inner>>?
* Manually implement further traits for ExistingOrNew
  - Like Display, Hex, etc…
* Is the deref on ExistingOrNew an abuse?
* Due to crossbeam-epoch, destruction of keys and values may be moved *past* the destructor of the map.
  - Add 'static bounds as a temporary solution ✔
  - Explore if this can be worked around by using a separate Collector and flush it in the destructor
