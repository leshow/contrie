* Sets
* Maybe some other types (for eg. clone types instead of arcing them?)
* Parametrize the things with specification about sequential consistency
  - So people can rely on relative order of insertions, etc.
* Rayon support
* Valgrind into CI
* Split the raw/mod.rs into multiple files? It is definitely getting a bit long.
* Some refactoring around the pointer juggling in raw
  - The manual casting seems a bit error prone
  - Should we have our own wrapper that loads and gives some king of Option<Either<&Payload, &Inner>>?
* Instead of smallvecs, we could use the raw allocator API, allocate a struct like { len, data: [ptr; 0] } and cast it around.
  - Boxed slice won't work, because it's a fat pointer and these don't fit well into atomics
* Manually implement further traits for ExistingOrNew
  - Like Display, Hex, etcâ€¦
* Is the deref on ExistingOrNew an abuse?
* If the Data node was turned from an array to concurrent linked list, it should be possible to get rid of the Config::Payload: Clone bound.
  That in turn could give us some more flexibility in designing the APIs
* BUG: Due to crossbeam-epoch, destruction of keys and values may be moved *past* the destructor of the map.
  - Explore if this can be worked around by using a separate Collector and flush it in the destructor
